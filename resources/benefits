Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Console: You configure everything manually through a UI. If you need to replicate the setup (e.g.,
for another environment like staging or another region), you repeat the clicks. Mistakes creep in easily.

SST/CDK: Your infrastructure is defined in code (sst.config.ts). You can version it with Git, reuse
 it across projects, and modify it programmatically. For example, changing the API route from /test to /status
 is a one-line edit, not a multi-step Console process.

Automation and Consistency
Console: Uploading a new version of your Go code means recompiling, zipping, and uploading again—every time.
 Missteps (e.g., forgetting to update the handler) can break things.

SST/CDK: Running npx sst deploy automates the build, upload, and deployment.
It ensures your Lambda function and API Gateway are always in sync with your code and config.
SST even handles the Go compilation for you under the hood.


Scalability for Complex Applications
Console: Fine for a single Lambda and one endpoint, but what if you need 10 endpoints,
DynamoDB integration, or SQS queues? Configuring this manually becomes a nightmare.
SST/CDK: You can define multiple resources in code effortlessly. Add a new route?
Just call api.root.addResource('status'). Need a database? Add a cdk.aws_dynamodb.Table construct.
It scales with your project’s complexity without extra grunt work.


Console: Changes are hard to track—who configured what, and when? Sharing setups with
teammates means writing docs or hoping they replicate your clicks.
SST/CDK: Your infrastructure lives in a Git repo. Teammates clone it,
run npx sst deploy, and get the exact same setup. It’s reproducible and auditable.
