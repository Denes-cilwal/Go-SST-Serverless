- you have your go code , you have your cdk code
- you need to build your main.go file into a binary and that is what going to zipped from our function to lambda
- When you run lambda.Start(app.Handler), AWS Lambda itself is not running inside your Go code.
Instead, your Go application is deployed to AWS Lambda, and AWS automatically calls your
Handler function when an event occurs.

 Where is AWS Lambda?
  - AWS Lambda is a cloud service that runs your function in response to an event.
  -  Your Go code does not start AWS Lambda—instead, AWS Lambda runs your code when needed.


What Happens Behind the Scenes?
You deploy your Go program to AWS Lambda.

Your Go program is packaged and uploaded to AWS Lambda as a function.
Example: You use the AWS CLI, AWS Console, or a deployment tool like Terraform.
AWS Lambda runs your function when an event occurs.

Example events:
An API request from API Gateway
A file upload in S3
A message received in SQS
A scheduled event in EventBridge
AWS Lambda calls lambda.Start(Handler).

When AWS Lambda starts your function, lambda.Start() registers your Handler function.
AWS then waits for an event.
When an event comes, AWS automatically calls Handler() with the event data.
Your function processes the event and returns a response.

Your handler function processes the event.
AWS Lambda takes the response and sends it back to the service that triggered the function.



Why Set Headers in the Response?
Content-Type: application/json

Ensures that the response is recognized as JSON.
Helps clients (browsers, mobile apps, other services) correctly interpret the response.
CORS Headers (Access-Control-Allow-Origin, etc.)

Allows web browsers to make requests to your API from a different domain.
Without these, browsers might block API requests due to CORS restrictions.
Security & API Gateway Compatibility

Some headers ensure the API behaves correctly when using authentication (Authorization header).
API Gateway might require certain headers to properly relay the response.



What Does "Serverless" Mean Here?
In both cases—whether you deployed via the AWS Console or used SST—you’re indeed working with a serverless architecture.
"Serverless" doesn’t mean there are no servers involved; rather,
it means you don’t have to manage them. AWS handles the provisioning, scaling, and maintenance of the
underlying infrastructure. In your example:

AWS Lambda: Executes your Go code on-demand, spinning up compute resources only when a request hits
 and shutting them down afterward.

API Gateway: Routes HTTP requests to your Lambda function without requiring a persistent server.
When you deployed through the AWS Console, you likely uploaded your Go binary (e.g., main) to Lambda,
configured an API Gateway trigger, and set up basic settings manually. That’s serverless because there’s
 no EC2 instance or container you’re directly managing—AWS abstracts it all away.

Using SST with the AWS CDK achieves the same serverless outcome, but it shifts how you define and manage
that infrastructure. Instead of clicking through the AWS Console, you describe your Lambda function and
API Gateway in code (TypeScript in this case), and SST deploys it for you
